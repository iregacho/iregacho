  Welcome to iregacho's github! Here you can find a random assortment of modules that have finally been liberated from the clutch of Isaiah's harddrive.
  
# About Isaiah Regacho
  In Isaiah's early life, a misunderstanding between his parents and his teacher enrolled him into a ESL (English as a Second Language) program. C was his first language. By 2022, Isaiah had learned two other languages: Python and Ladder Logic. After weeks in a technical doldrum, his need to develop and discover takes over and causes a burst event in which a new project is birthed into the world. As a engineering student, this was satisfied by various projects. These personal projects became numerous and have slowly matured into projects that can be found here.
  
## His Education 
  Isaiah's six year academic journey began in 2015 and included an institution, a college, and a university.

### British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT)
  Isaiah had learned the arts of high-level programming in a C programming course as part of the Mechatronics and Robotics program. As soon as he had figured out the assignment operator "=" functions differently than the mathematical equal sign, Isaiah found himself immersed in the problem solving nature of programming. An excercise in searching for prime numbers, Isaiah had the brilliant idea search for a specific number of primes in each number. Turns out, Isaiah had developed a program that would find numbers with x prime factors in their canonical representation which is described by the Fundamental theorem of arithetic.
  
  Learning to program with microcontrollers opened up a new world of possibilites as his programs could now interact with the world itself. Having just learned assembly for the MSP430, one of Isaiah's earliest burst events had created a music player. He carefully counted cycles between the toggling of a GPIO pin by programming loops with NOP. With predefined total loops needed for each note, he wrote in assembly the order of notes to play Watermelon Man by Herbie Hancock, nice.
  
  PLC programming was also introduced in BCIT. Isaiah found programming PLCs to be an enjoyable excercise in logic implementation. In combination with the state machine structures enforced in the course, Isaiah learned to appreciate usefulness of self-implemented guidelines and formatting. He learned how multiple inputs can be managed and how an entire process can be controlled.
  
### Camosun College
  Taking another C programming course gave Isaiah the opportunity to refine the formatting of his code. Over time, Isaiah discovered value in keeping a blank template for consistent headers across projects. Very little evidence has been found regarding the C++ education he received.
  
### University of Victoria
  Isaiah's programming had not seen major leaps during the pursuit of his Electrical Engineering degree. MATLAB which was also introduced in BCIT saw much more usage at UVic. Isaiah had learned Python in the brief work terms between academic terms. He was eager to utilize python to develop his own applications. When the opportunity arose, so did a Tkinter Python GUI. The programs he developed included fatigue detection using EEG and blood glucose predictions with an integrated Parkes Error Grid. 
  
## His Work Experience
  His early professional career was shaped by the desired to cultivate his programming skills.
  
### Dynamic Attractions
  An engineer suggested to Isaiah to learn python. The main goal was to parse data various tests from the same day and plot a selected variable from each test file for summary of the day. Tkinter eluded him but Isaiah made a terminal application that featured a cursor, a generic menu, and fast navigation of a directory system. Using WASD, W and S were used for changing the selected item. Pressing A would move to a parent directory. Pressing D would either open the directory or select the file. Very nice.

### Redlen
  Isaiah spent this co-op term improving the user quality of a custom application. This introduced Isaiah to the GUI capabilites of Python. As a bug was removed, other bugs would begin to reveal themselves. Each time a bug was squashed, the operators found themselves not having to reset the application nearly as often if at all. This robustness was greatly appreciated and exposed a memory leak which would consume more and more RAM. The memory leak would eventually crash the application due to the finite resources. This would lead to Isaiah's discovery of cProfiles.

### Kobelt
  This term was disrupted by Covid-19. Isaiah still managed to create an application for generating QR codes.

### British Columbia Institute of Technology
  Isaiah became an Assistant Instructor in the very same program his academic journey began. Searching for a final co-op employer led him to a Part-Time opportunity at BCIT. For the evolution of the Mechatronics program and the requirements of the co-op program, Isaiah developed a prototype linear axis that would later be refined and deployed in the laboratory. Isaiah was able to control a microcontroller (MSP430) with a python application. The application would allow the user to control the velocity of the linear axis. It would also plot both the commanded signal and the feedback signal from the MCPV ClearPath motor.
  
## Interests
  Isaiah can often be found, or rather heard, playing a multitude of instruments. He picked up skateboarding in 2018 which became his preferred method for traversing accross the UVic campus. Covid forced classes online and Isaiah has sinced missed riding his pennyboard everywhere.

# Projects
  This github is very fresh. It will grow. Give it time.

## IzyGUI
  Developing application was fun but redesigning one every time was not as fun. The layout of the GUI is modified with the app.XML file. The title, colors, font, window size, and tabs can be modified. The number of tabs present is based on the labels provided in the app.XML file. Each page or tab has two control frames and a display frame. One control frame is positioned on the top left. The display frame, typically the largest sits on the top right. The secondary controls sits underneathe the other two frames. The side control frame is intended for buttons. The bottom control frame is intented for widgets that occupy a longer horizontal space. The display frame usually holds data in the form of text or a matplotlib plot.

# Contact
  Contact me through isaiah.regacho@gmail.com. Need help using one of my programs, just want learn something, or offer a career opportunity, please feel to reach out. As for my students, I will always be more than willing to help.

# Project Development
  Projects are developed for fun. Suggestions for features or tweaks are appreciated. Appreciation in the form of my local currency is also welcome. I'm currently working on my student loans.
